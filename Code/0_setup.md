# Introduction 
I assume you followed the steps I mentionned [here](https://github.com/jdnmiguel/Code-corner/blob/main/geospatial.md) to set up your environment. Then, open your anaconda prompt and activate your environment:
```
conda activate "/path/to/your/course/folder/envpygis"
```
- Now the text in front of your prompt should have changed, you should install the ISLP package. 
```
pip install ISLP
```
- Open a jupyter lab notebook and replace "path" with your class path
```
jupyter lab --notebook-dir="C:/Users/path"
```
